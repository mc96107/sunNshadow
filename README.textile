This is a tool for calculating sun azimuth and altitude at any given time. It can also determine if a shadow is cast from a specified obstacle.

Sun position
In the beginning the latitude, longitude and current time are automatically set. Then by moving any slider or inputting any value, the results are presented in the appropriate fields.

Shadow
By pressing the "obstacle" switch, the phone heading is determined to be used as the direction towards the obstacle. This can also be changed manually (obstacle direction). In the fields obstacle distance and height, the values for the obstacle are declared. In the “sun shadow” field the difference between the distance from the obstacle and the shadow length is calculated for the specified time. If the difference is < 0 then the shadow overlaps the calculation point.

Batch shadow calculation
By pressing the button "calculation per hour and month" the shadow is calculated for every hour and month. A list is printed for the times when the shadow reaches the calculation point.
